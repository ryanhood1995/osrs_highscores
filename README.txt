This program is designed to send congratulatory text messages to my friends and me when we level up
our accounts on Old School Runescape.  To run successfully, the friends phone numbers and usernames
must be entered into a file called 'private.py'.  I did not include this file in the remote repository for privacy reasons.
To start the program to run forever (even after crash), run forever.py.  To start the program to run
until it crashes, run driver.py.

This code is designed to run on a windows machine.
