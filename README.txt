This program is designed to send congratulatory text messages to my friends and me when we level up
our accounts on Old School Runescape.  To run successfully, the friends phone numbers and usernames
must be entered into the respective files.  Also in those files are short methods which return a phone
number, given the first name of the desired person.  I did not include the full files for privacy reasons.
To start the program to run forever (even after crash), run forever.py.  To start the program to run
until it crashes, run text_congrats.py.

This code is designed to run on a windows machine.
